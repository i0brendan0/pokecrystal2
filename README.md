To build the game, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

List of changes
* Moves are updated to the latest Gen stats with a couple changing type. No fairy type.
* Ghost-type is now Special, while Dark-type is now Physical.
* The Celebi event is made possible to start after defeating Red at Mt. Silver.
* Many bugs left from Gen 2 are fixed. Even some that weren't widely known about.
* Each Johto badge increases the level that traded Pokemon obey. Kanto badges are not taken into account.
* Some moves have been given the correct name based on limits from Gen 2.
* Steel is no longer resistant to Dark and Ghost.
* Poison is now super-effective to Bug as in Gen 1.
* Pokemon that evolve by trading now can be evolved using a Link Cable.
* Pokemon that evolve by trading while holding a specific item now can evolve using that item.
* The phone list size is increased to 20. 
* The number at which Pokemon evolve by happiness is decreased to 200.
* Some Pokemon have a second type.
* All Pokemon will now be able to be obtained without trading. To do - Gen 1 starters, Legendary Birds, and Mews.
* The Odd Egg Pokemon list has been reworked. All Pokemon have an equal chance of being shiny and a roughly equal chance at hatching. The DVs for each non-shiny Pokemon are maxed out, while the shiny versions are the max available, not including Tyrogue which has the same Attack and Defense DVs
* Some trainers' Pokemon have been given different DVs. Special trainers now carry shiny Pokemon.
* The password to reset the clock has been removed. Now it will reset when you hit Yes. 
* You will get $5000 when starting the game.
* All instances where the game checks which version of Crystal are removed. There is and will only be one version to make.
* Poison knocking out a Pokemon will reduce its friendship by less than normal.
* You will be able to find Link Cables for sale at both Department stores.
* All evolutionary items are for sale at the Celadon Department store.
* You will get 10 Poke Balls to start with.
* Your Mom will get many more different items when she goes shopping. You will be able to get all of the decorations including the trophies. Something special is available to those who are super savers.
* Sonic Boom will now show its Japanese animation in battle. Cause why would they change it in the first place...?
* Magnet Bomb has been added to the available moves. Only Magnemite and Magneton learn it so far.
* Sweet Honey has been added into the game. It now is a hold item that can be used to increase the chance of catching a Pokemon.
* 10 TMs will be given out if they are picked up by the player or given to the player from an NPC.

List of things left to do

* Add Gen 1 starters, Legendary Birds, Mew, and Mewtwo into the game to be caught.
* Update all trainers' Pokemon with newly aquired moves.
* Edit certain trainers' Pokemon to fit better with other edits.
